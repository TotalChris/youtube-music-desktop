# YouTube Music Desktop

Desktop client for YouTube Music, because YouTube didn't do it.

Includes native platform features like media playback buttons on thumbnails.

Currently only available for [Windows](https://github.com/alex-lushiku/youtube-music-desktop/releases), but have a look at [this](https://ytmusic.app) for MacOS.
